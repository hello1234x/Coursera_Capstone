    "San Jose, the cultural and financial center of Silicon Valley, is the largest city in Northern California by both population and area. It is the third-most populous city in California (after Los Angeles and San Diego) and the tenth-most populous in the United States. Located in the center of the Santa Clara Valley, San Jose is notable as a center of innovation, for its affluence, Mediterranean climate, and extremely high cost of living. \n",

    "Business stakeholders are interested in opening a bubble tea shop in San Jose but is concerned about current COVID situation. According to studies, a bubble tea shop with to-go and delivery service would probably operate better under the pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this project is to find the most potential location to open a bubble tea shop in San Jose. We will focus on all the neighborhoods in San Jose. Neighbourhood rent is another factor that would be taken into consideration."
